Hello friends in this video I have built a mini Rotary tumbler polishing machine,
This machine is powered by Arduino and custom PCB User can set the time for tumbler rotation.

This mini tumbler rotary polisher is used to polish small metal parts, 
Abrasive granules is placed in the tumbler and then we have to put metal parts in this tumbler

after that user have to set the time like how long we need to run this machine and what will be speed of the rotation
all this is done by using mini HMI, I have used nextion 2.8" HMI in this project.



# VIDEO
Here is the complete video of the project 


# COMPONENT USED

High Torque DC motor

L298N motor driver

Arduino Nano 

Wooden board of 12mm thick

20 x 20 aluminum profile

8mm pillow bearing

8mm SS rod

T8 lead screw and nut

Timing pulley

Timing belt

Here I have used 6mm Acrylic sheet for making the side panel of the machine, I design the 3d design in fusion 360 
and used same software to convert its g-code which is GRBL based.

then I used my home made CNC engraving machine to cut out the part, I have used 500W in this CNC machine and 2mm milling bit

Then I bring four 608Z bearing 8mm ID and 22mm OD I placed this bearing at ther position.

Then I bring a high torque 12V DC motor, this motor

Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current 

in a part of the motor.DC motors were the first form of motor widely used, as they could be powered from existing direct-current lighting power distribution systems. 

A DC motor’s speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of the current in its field windings.

>> Base Motor RPM: 18000


>> Operating Voltage: 6-18 V

>> Rated Voltage: 12 V

>> Rated Torque: 34.2 N-cm

>> Stall Torque: 300 N-cm

>> Gearbox Dimensions: 25×37 (LxW) mm
